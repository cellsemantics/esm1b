The E.coli LTEE data was taken from the paper - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5788700/. The data was sourced from - https://github.com/benjaminhgood/LTEE-metagenomic

In this analysis, the E. coli LTEE experiment dataset was utilized. Out of the 22,857 missense variants, 18059 were successfully matched with their corresponding esm1b scores following data processing.

Preprocessing of the Data
All the DNA and Protein sequences for each gene were taken from NCBI - https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/017/985/GCF_000017985.1_ASM1798v1/

Esm1b model
The pretrained model was sourced from - https://github.com/ntranoslab/esm-variants

Analysis
Script1.ipynb and Script2.R were employed for the analysis, while Script3.ipynb was utilized for generating plots of analysis.
